## Why should we hire you?

* To beat your competition, I have 3 interviews left this week, with company X, Y and Z.
* You should hire me because I not only meet the job requirements, but I also bring a passion for innovation and a track record of exceeding expectations.
* I will expand your company's business and drive profits.
* Because you won‚Äôt like what happens if you don‚Äôt hire me
* "Words are cheap. Give me a task, and I'll do it for free so you can see my work."
* "You hope I'll create more value for the company than what you'll pay me - and I will, even more than you expect. But I will also make sure every person on my team creates more value than they would without me here."
* Because I'm so much more curious and passionate than anyone else you could possibly hire.
I might not be the best at the job now, but I'll be damn certain to ask whoever I can and do whatever I must do to become better.
* ‚ÄúBecause I feel like I‚Äôm already on your team‚Äù
`It worked because I got hired at Microsoft 10 years ago when I applied for just 1 job.`
* Because I'm the best person to fill the role you need and it's your need not mine, then what is it you have to offer an employee? What advancement opportunities are available at your company? What education or certificate programs are offered? Do you send folks to conferences?
* If you won‚Äôt hire me, you have to invest time and energy in another candidate. I can save it
* Just say their vision statement to them as your vision for the future. Done. - Suggested my friends the same after reading the Infinite Game by Simon Sinek and seemed to work. üòÇ
* "If you have to ask at this point, we're definitely not a fit. Bye." :)
* I follow rules and I challange them.
* You meant to lead with why you‚Äôre worthy on me first

* Whenever the interviewer asks "Do you have any questions for me?"
